## Notes

- Plays the system `Beep` sound using `System.Media.SystemSounds.Beep.Play()`.
- The tone is determined by the operating system's default beep sound; frequency and duration cannot be customised through this activity.
- If the system has no audio output device or the beep sound is muted, the activity completes silently without error.
